# xgboost_6ma
Code Implementation for 'xgboost6ma' Paper
Given the constraints of limited memory and GPU memory, to execute 'xgboost6ma', it is necessary to first perform feature extraction using the associated DeepModel. The features extracted should be stored in .pkl files. Subsequently, you can proceed to train and evaluate the XGBoost classifier using the script run_xgboost.py
